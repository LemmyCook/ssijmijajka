    <h1>You followed a malicious link!</h1>
    <p>Malware has been installed on your device. Every action you take is now being monitored, and your data is within
        a hacker's reach. You probably won't find the consequences for a long time, as results of these attacks can lay
        dormant for a long time.</p>

    <h2>What does this mean for you?</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Your personal files, passwords, and sensitive information are now compromised.</li>
        <li>The malware has the ability to track your activity, record keystrokes, and access your camera or
            microphone.
        </li>
        <li>Attempting to remove the malware may trigger additional consequences.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Proceed carefully... and remember, somebody's watching..</p>
