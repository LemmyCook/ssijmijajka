    <h1>You followed a phishing link!</h1>
    <p>Your credentials have been stolen, meaning your usernames, passwords, and any associated data are now in a
        hacker's possession.</p>

    <h2>What does this mean for you?</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Your private information is no longer secure.</li>
        <li>If you've reused your password elsewhere, those accounts are now at risk.</li>
        <li>It is recommended you change your passwords immediately â€” though it might already be too late.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You've been warned. Security is only as strong as its weakest link.</p>
